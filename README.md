# Forecastr

Forecastr is an open source Weather API wrapper for OpenWeatherMap.

Forecastr is an Elixir flavour of http://wttr.in that talks directly to OpenWeatherMap.
Aim of the project is to provide a website similar to wttr.in written entirely in elixir

**NOTE**: If you want to play with this project you have to obtain an api key from http://openweathermap.org/

**Project status: initial. (very pre-alphaish)**
